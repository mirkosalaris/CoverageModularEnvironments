This version of the aws results contains all the results for Frederickson and
Integer algorithms for N=30,60,120; m=5,10,20 and the three patterns: random,
decreasing, increasing. The file that refer to Fred, Int can be properly read considering the same order of the content of the file smN.dump

For AHP we only have the results for the 9 cases with N=30 (and in a separate folder one result for N=60). As before, the file smN_ahp_30.dump is key to interpret the ahp dump files.

For this version, the graphs used have been extracted using Manhattan distances to
connect the portals between one another and the scale from xml to meters has been
corrected.

The modules used for this results are:
little_module = "Valleceppi_P0"  # length: 171
middle_module = "scuola_3"  # length: 270
